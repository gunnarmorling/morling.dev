<p>If you love to attend conferences around the world without actually leaving the comfort of your house,
2021 certainly was (and is!) a perfect year for you.
Tons of online conferences, many of them available for free,
are hosting talks on all kinds of topics,
and virtual conference platforms are getting better, too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the year is slowly reaching its end,
I thought it might be nice to do a quick recap and gather in one place all the talks on Debezium and change data capture (CDC) which I did in 2021.
An overarching theme for these talks was to discuss different CDC usage patterns and putting Debezium into the context of solving common data engineering tasks by combining it with other open-source projects such as Infinispan and Apache Pinot.
In order to not feel too lonely in front of the screen and make things a bit more exciting,
I decided to team up with some amazing friends from the open-source community for the different talks.
A big thank you for these phantastic collaborations to <a href="https://twitter.com/karesti">Katia Aresti</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kennybastani">Kenny Bastani</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/hpgrahsl">Hans-Peter Grahsl</a>!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So without further ado,
here are four Debezium talks I had the pleasure to co-present in 2021.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_dont_fear_outdated_caches_change_data_capture_to_the_rescue">Don&#8217;t Fear Outdated Caches – Change Data Capture to the Rescue!</h2>

</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As per an old saying in software engineering, there&#8217;s only two hard things: cache invalidation and naming things.
Well, turns out the first is solved actually ;)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this talk at the <a href="http://www.bordeauxjug.org/">Bordeaux Java User Group</a>, Katia Aresti from the <a href="https://infinispan.org/">Infinispan</a> team and I explored how users of an application can benefit from low response times by means of read data models, persisted in distributed caches close to the user.
When working with a central database as the authoritative data source&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;thus receiving all the write requests&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;these local caches need to be kept up to date, of course. This is where Debezium comes in:
any data changes are captured and propagated to the caches via Apache Kafka.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And as if the combination of Kafka, Infinispan and Debezium was not already exciting enough,
we also threw some Quarkus and Kafka Streams into the mix,
joining the data from multiple Debezium change data topics,
allowing to retrieve entire aggregate structures via a single key look-up from the local caches.
It&#8217;s still on our agenda to describe that archicture in a blog post, so stay tuned for that.</p>

<div class="paragraph">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While some folks already might feel something like microservices fatigue,
the fact is undeniable that organizing business functionality into multiple, loosely coupled services has been one of the biggest trends in software engineering over the last years.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course these services don&#8217;t exist in isolation, but they need to exchange data and cooperate;
Apache Kafka has become the de-facto standard as the backbone for connecting services,
facilitating asynchronous event-driven communication between them.
In this joint presentation, my dear friend Hans-Peter Grahsl and I set out to explore what role change data capture can play in such architectures,
and which patterns there are for applying CDC to solve common problems related to handling data in microservices architectures.
We focused on three patterns in particular, each implemented using log-based CDC via Debezium:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <em>outbox pattern</em> for reliable, eventually consistent data exchange between microservices, without incurring unsafe dual writes or tight coupling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>strangler fig pattern</em> for gradually extracting microservices from existing monolithic applications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>saga pattern</em> for coordinating long-running business transactions across multiple services, ensuring such activity gets consistently applied or aborted by all participating services</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We presented that talk at several conferences, including <a href="https://www.confluent.de/events/kafka-summit-europe-2021/advanced-change-data-streaming-patterns-in-distributed-systems/">Kafka Summit Europe</a>, <a href="https://2021.berlinbuzzwords.de/session/change-data-streaming-patterns-distributed-systems">Berlin BuzzWords</a>, and <a href="https://jlove.konfy.care/schedule.html">jLove</a>.
We also did a variation of the presentation at Flink Forward, discussing how to implement the different CDC patterns using Debezium and Apache Flink.
The recording of this session should be published soon, in the meantime you can find the slides <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/hpgrahsl/change-data-streaming-patterns-in-distributed-systems-at-flink-forward-2021">here</a>.
I also highly recommend to take a look at <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/06/14/application-modernization-patterns-apache-kafka-debezium-and-kubernetes#after_the_migration__modernization_challenges">this blog post</a> by Bilgin Ibryam,
in which he discusses these patterns in depth.</p>

</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Traditionally, there has been a chasm between operational databases backing enterprise applications (i.e. <em>OLTP</em> systems),
and systems meant for ad-hoc analytics use cases, such as queries run by a business analyst in the back office. (<em>OLAP</em> systems).
Data would typically be propagated in batches from the former to the latter,
resulting in multi-hour delays until the analytics system would be able to run queries on changed production data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the current shift to user-facing analytics, we are observing nothing less than a revolution:
the ability to serve low-latency analytical queries on large data sets to the end users of an application,
based on data that is really fresh (seconds old, rather than hours).
Compared to response times and freshness guarantees you&#8217;d typically get from earlier generations of data warehouses, this is a game changer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this model, Debezium is used to capture all data changes from the operational database and propagate them into the analytics system.
Kenny Bastani of <a href="https://www.startree.ai/">StartTree</a> and I spoke about the opportunities and use cases enabled by combining Debezium with <a href="https://pinot.apache.org/">Apache Pinot</a>, a realtime distributed OLAP datastore, at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/apache-pinot/events/279202435/">Pinot meet-up</a>.
A massive shout-out to Kenny again for putting together an awesome demo, showing how to use Debezium and the outbox pattern for getting the data into Apache Kafka,
transform the data and ingest it into Pinot, and do some really cool visualizations via Apache Superset.</p>

</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After talking about three different CDC patterns,
Hans-Peter and I decided to explore one of the patterns in some more depth and did this talk focusing exclusively on the strangler fig pattern.
Existing monolithic applications are a reality in many enterprises,
and oftentimes it&#8217;s just not feasible to replace them with a microservices architecture all at once in one single migration step.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is where the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerFigApplication.html">strangler fig pattern</a> comes in:
it helps you to gradually extract components from a monolith into separate services,
relying on CDC for keeping the data stores of the different systems in sync.
A routing component, such as Nginx or Envoy Proxy, in front of all the systems sends each incoming request to that system which is in charge of a specific part of the domain at a given point in time during the migration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This talk (which we presented at <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/live">MongoDB.Live</a>, <a href="https://www.confluent.io/events/kafka-summit-americas-2021/dissecting-our-legacy-the-strangler-fig-pattern-with-debezium-apache-kafka/">Kafka Summit Americas</a>, and <a href="https://romania.voxxeddays.com/talk/?id=3318">VoxxedDays Romania</a>), also contains a demo, we show how to implement the strangler fig pattern using Debezium,
gradually moving data from a legacy system&#8217;s MySQL database over to the MongoDB instance of a new microservice, which is built using Quarkus.</p>
