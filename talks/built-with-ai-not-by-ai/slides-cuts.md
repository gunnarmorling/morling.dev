<span class="aside">Benchmarks are the ground truth, not Claude's narration.</span>

Note:
It will name the cause of a regression, or the reason a change is faster, with
total confidence and no measurement. Often the explanation is convincing and
the number didn't move. Sometimes it got worse.

The rules come later, when we climb out. Here, just let it cost something.

## Five causes. Four refuted.

<blockquote class="transcript">
"The benchmark says I was wrong again — it got <strong>worse</strong>."

Note:
An encode regression on the writer. Each guess came with arithmetic behind it,
which makes a guess read like a finding. Allocation counting showed the branch
allocated less, not more. Removing the "cause" made things slower, twice.

What found it in the end: `-prof gc`, a measurement.

Deciding when to stop stays with you, both ways.

Note:
PR #1103 as first opened: one commit, one reference page, six lines added and
four removed. It documented a fix that had already landed.

Writing down which physical types a BigDecimal predicate covers meant checking
it, and checking it turned up three more wrong answers: #1141, #1142, #1144.
The PR was force-pushed nineteen times and merged four days later at 37 files,
+2,334 −159, under a new title: "List the predicate literals each column type
takes, and correct the orders it exposed". That is where epic #1198 began.

<img class="callback" src="_inputs/images/x-2026-01-17-if-else.png" alt="Jan 17: yet another if/else is not gonna save us, mate">

The agent will re-solve a solved problem locally
rather than find the existing solution. Every time. Cheerfully.

Note:
"Yet another if/else" was funny in January.

This is why "search for existing patterns before writing new code" is written
into my agent instructions at all. It is not a style preference, it is a
countermeasure.

The cleanup is real work, and it is never the interesting work.

## What I was handed for free

- A complete written specification
- A public conformance corpus of test files
- Three independent implementations to check against
- Correctness = <em>the bytes match, or they don't</em>
- Performance = <em>a number</em>
- Greenfield code. One decision-maker.

Note:
Every one of these is a gift. I did not earn any of them.

Call back to the start: this is exactly why I picked the project. I chose the best
case on purpose.

---

## What you have on Monday

- A twelve-year-old system, no specification
- Tests that assert whatever the code already does
- "Correct" means the client hasn't called
- Four teams and a client architect with a veto

<span class="aside">Written in April. It took another turn before I worked that way.</span>

Note:
Written in April, long before this talk: the moat is in everything describing a
system's behaviour verifiably. APIs, executable specifications, test suites.
For functional and non-functional requirements. "Much more focused on the
'What' and 'Why' than on the 'How'."

"I wrote this down in April. It took another turn before I actually worked that
way." Knowing it and living by it are different things.

---

## The <em>what</em> is more than the feature

You own the architecture:

- Invariants
- Threading
- Allocation budget

Note:
Otherwise "check the what" sounds like "click through the feature and see if
it works".

The what includes everything the design promises: which invariants hold, who
touches which thread, how much a read allocates. An agent can write code that
does the right thing and breaks all three.

<img class="post" src="images/x-2026-03-30-known-unknowns.png" alt="Mar 30: LLMs are great for solving known unknowns. They are confidently bad for dealing with unknown unknowns.">

Note:
A loop catches known unknowns: things somebody knew to check. The geo bug was an
unknown unknown. Nobody writes a test for a field that doesn't exist.

So loops take most of the checking off your plate, and expertise keeps the
rest.

---

<!-- .slide: class="hero" -->

## The question is never "is the AI good?"

It's "<em>what is my oracle?</em>"

---

## The oracles have bugs too

- parquet-java: `in` with `Set.of` throws; multi-value `notIn` returns every row
- DuckDB: `-0.0 = 0.0`
- A stale jar in `~/.m2` silently shadowing the code under test

Note:
Each of these produced plausible, wrong answers during the audit.

A reference implementation is still an implementation. Disagreement is where
you look; it isn't automatically the other side that's right.

---

<!-- .slide: class="hero" -->

<blockquote class="transcript">
"The oracle takes each row's value from the reader under test: values() reads the column through RowReader.getValue / getRawValue. A decode defect therefore passes on both sides."
<cite>Me, reviewing a test, Sep 15</cite>
</blockquote>

Note:
A real one, caught in review two weeks ago. The expected values came from the
code being tested, so a decoding bug would have produced matching wrong answers
on both sides.

The fix: expected values written independently, by the fixture generator, into
files next to the test data.

---

<!-- .slide: class="hero" -->

## Changes to the oracle get read line by line.

<span class="aside">Exclusion lists. Expected values. Skipped tests.</span>

Note:
The answer to "it edited the test until it agreed". Checking the what is worth
nothing if the thing doing the checking can be changed by the thing being
checked. So that part is core, and core gets every diff.

---

<!-- .slide: class="hero" -->

## The agent doesn't write throwaway scripts to look at a Parquet file.

It runs `hardwood`.

Note:
And here's the self-referential part that people remember:

I built the tool my agent debugs my library with. The CLI exists for users,
but the agent is its heaviest user.

---

## The generalisation

An agent reaching for a one-off script
is telling you your domain is missing an <em>instrument</em>.

Build it. Even if only the agent uses it.

Note:
Their version: the client system nobody can inspect without raising a ticket.
The data pipeline whose state lives in someone's head. You have been tolerating
that because *you* knew the workarounds. The agent doesn't, and it will
cheerfully invent one.

---

## Even when I vibe-code, I ask for instruments

- A strike log: what the detector heard, and why it rejected it
- A test mode that plays known notes
- Recording a session to replay against the detector

Note:
Back to the note trainer. I didn't read how the pitch detection works, but I
asked for all three of these, because "it didn't register my note" tells
neither me nor the agent anything.

Not reading the how only works if you can see the what. These are how you see
it.

Note:
"Coding agents work best with a tight feedback loop. 'Here's a bug with a
reproducer, go and fix it' works great." The question was whether the same holds
for performance.

"This function is slow, profile it on the Z300 and address the bottleneck" has
become a workflow. And it can measure instead of guess.

## Durable knowledge

<span class="aside">Screenshot: the n300-profiling skill → _inputs/images/03-n300-skill.svg</span>

![](_inputs/images/03-n300-skill.svg)

Note:
A personal bare-metal box for profiling. The skill tells the agent how to get
on it, how to run the harness, and — mostly — what not to conclude from it.

---

## The method, written down

```markdown
`perfnorm` to classify (instructions/op + IPC + misses
→ compute vs memory vs branch bound)
→ `async` flamegraph for *where*
→ `perfasm` for the exact instructions.

Prove a suspected bottleneck by *changing the supply*
of the resource, not just reading the profile.
```

<span class="aside">From the skill</span>

Note:
The last line is the important one. A profile shows where time goes. It does
not show why. You find out why by changing something and measuring again.

---

## Dead ends

- Skip the per-batch trim → <em>7% slower</em>
- Pre-size the accumulator → <em>slower</em>
- Change the final-batch handoff → <em>noise</em>

<span class="aside">The time-weighted CPU profile kept pointing the wrong way.</span>

Note:
Each fix had a plausible explanation behind it. Measurement refuted all three.

Time-weighted CPU profiles kept over-weighting a few large memory moves, and
sent us after them repeatedly.

---

## The instrument lies too

- A stale CPU pin at 800 MHz: every number ~2× slow, nothing says so
- One memory channel: anything parallel <em>looks</em> bandwidth-bound
- A 7 W part: whatever runs second is penalised by heat
- A reproducer spun on row 0 for 65 minutes, on 8 cores

Note:
Each of these produced numbers that looked like results.

The stale pin is the nastiest: a previous run set the clock to its base
frequency and never restored it. JMH ran fine. Everything was twice as slow.

The spinning reproducer: its loop never advanced to the next row, and the time
cap was only checked between rounds. One round never ended.

---

<!-- .slide: class="hero" -->

## The instrument needs an oracle too.

---

## The rules

- Measure before naming a cause
- An untested theory says "untested" in the same sentence
- A/B/A, never A/B
- "Is any of this making a difference <em>end to end</em>?"
- A hard time cap, checked <em>inside</em> every run

Note:
The fourth is the one I use most. A micro-benchmark regression of 16 ns per
page is real and irrelevant. Bound the end-to-end share before probing further.

All five are written down for the agent now. Each one is an answer to midnight:
the five causes, "this drives me crazy".

- **Sep 8:** "why are you adding the claude session to commits again, in claude.md we say don't do it"
- **Sep 14:** moved into the settings file

Note:
The co-author trailer. A rule in prose, broken four days later, then moved
into configuration where it can't be broken.

Same path for filler prose in the docs: a complaint in August, a memory entry,
then a check in the PR build.

---

## Promoted

|---|---|
| Never use `var` | custom Error Prone check |
| No legacy `/** */` JavaDoc | custom Error Prone check |
| No filler prose in the docs | `docs-prose-check.py` in the PR build |

Two of these are compiler errors I wrote myself. The third is a Python script
that fails the build on marketing language in documentation.

## Teach the agent the pyramid

```markdown
## Priority frame: the Code Review Pyramid

Review effort is weighted by how expensive the issue is
to fix after merge.

When writing the findings file, sort by pyramid tier, not
by checklist section. A small API-shape concern outranks a
big style nit. Style items belong in a "Nits" footer.
```

<span class="aside">From the review skill</span>

Note:
The agent reviews too: other people's PRs, and its own output. Without the
pyramid, it sorts findings in the order it found them.

---

## AI reviews are noisy

Cut, don't report:

- Non-findings: "no API change here, looks fine"
- Taste calls with no written rule behind them
- Micro-optimisations on cold paths
- Polishing a test that is already correct

Note:
Early review files were noisy: on one PR I kept only the items that named a
real defect and cut the rest. A short review with five real defects beats a
long one I have to filter.

Same in their day jobs, with or without AI.

---

<!-- .slide: class="hero" -->

## Embeddings

A column of 768 floats per row.

The fast path for it was <em>slower</em> than reading plain float columns.

Note:
Vector embeddings stored as Parquet lists: every row is a list of exactly 768
floats. We had built a dedicated fast path for this shape. It lost to the
ordinary flat-column path, which should be its floor, not its ceiling.

Why?

---

<!-- .slide: class="hero" -->

## The batch was <em>512 MB</em>.

<span class="aside">Sized for ~6 MB. Batch sizing counted 4 bytes per row and ignored the 768.</span>

Note:
Batch sizing looked at the leaf type — a float, 4 bytes — and never at how many
values sit in one row. So a "row-count" batch held 768 times the intended data:
half a gigabyte instead of something that fits in the L2 cache.

The cost wasn't where the copy happened. It was how big the working set was.

The instrument that found it was perfnorm counting instructions and cycles. The
time-weighted profile never pointed at it.

---

## After the fix

| | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Time | ~690 ms | 437 ms |
| Cycles | 2.45 B | 1.50 B |
| Gap to flat columns | 1.77× | 1.07× |

<span class="aside">Single core, N300.</span>

Note:
The regular, non-fast path got faster too, because it shares the sizing: about
1.5 s down to 0.8 s.

It's a cache effect, so it should carry over to other machines, but it still
wants a confirmation on a multi-channel server before anyone quotes it. Why
that matters comes up in a few slides.

## Which is why this is a rule

```markdown
Before writing new code, search for existing patterns in the
same class/package that accomplish the same thing. Extract
repeated logic into helper methods rather than duplicating it.
```

Note:
Ordinary advice for humans. Load-bearing infrastructure for agents.

## The predicate audit

<span class="subtitle">About <em>72,000</em> predicate cells</span>

× 5 read paths

against parquet-java and DuckDB, in every PR build

<span class="aside">tools/predicate-audit · about three minutes</span>

Note:
Every literal kind a column takes, around stored values, in gaps, past the
range, at the edge cases: NaN payloads, signed zeros, padded decimals. Every
operator, every negated and set form. Read through the row reader and the
column reader, with and without metadata filtering.

After three runs it stopped finding defects in the rule, so now it guards
against regressions.

On your project: this is the golden master, built on purpose.

---

## Durable knowledge

<span class="subtitle">Every line is a mistake that will never happen again</span>

```markdown
- **This box is not for memory-bandwidth-scaling conclusions**
  (single channel makes almost anything parallel *look*
  bandwidth-bound)

- **Poll with a process match that can't match itself.**
  `pgrep -f "mvn … install"` over SSH matches the polling
  shell's own argv, so it reports "still running" forever.
```

Note:
Read the second one aloud. It's funny, it's specific, and it cost me an hour
once. Now it costs nobody anything, ever again.

This is the actual artefact of expertise in an agentic workflow: not the code
you wrote, the traps you wrote down.

Second example, from the hardwood CLI: the agent kept parsing Parquet footers
with a hand-written Python script. "Why did you do that instead of the skill?"
Once. Now it's written down that anything touching Parquet internals goes
through the CLI first.

Same for performance work: the rules from midnight (measure before naming a
cause, A/B/A, a hard time cap) are written down for the agent, not repeated in
every session.

them was pretty much one-shotted.

This is the first feedback loop in the talk, before it has a name: the test
vectors told the agent right from wrong. Make-or-buy moves wherever such a loop
exists.

"External dependencies now have to earn their place, and the bar has moved."

## Issue #1198

Started as a <em>small docs PR</em>.

Took a <em>week</em>.

Note:
I pulled one thread, and it kept coming. Each next step was cheap, so I took
it. A week later I had rewritten a whole area of the predicate code — well, and
it's better now, which is exactly the problem.

## You can delegate the work.

You can't delegate the <em>signature</em>.

Note:
The manager comparison holds for the workload and breaks down on
accountability.

For this room it's contractual. Your name, and your company's name, goes on
what you deliver to a client. "Claude wrote that part" is not an answer a
client accepts.

An engineering manager doesn't review how each line was written. They own what
gets delivered. That's the shift from the how to the what, and because the
signature stays with you, checking the what is not optional.

## Off the backburner

<span class="aside">Kept out of the deck, still worth having to hand.</span>

<!-- .slide: class="hero" -->

## Upgrade to current Java.

<span class="aside">Come for the runtime, stay for the language.</span>

Note:
Candidate aside, maybe for the "make it fast" beat. Hardwood targets Java 21
but is measured on 25; the Jan 31 numbers ran on Java 25.

The argument for this room: most client systems sit on 11 or 17. The runtime
improvements alone pay for the upgrade, without touching a line of code.
And an agent with a green test suite is exactly the tool for doing the upgrade;
I wrote in January that JDK upgrades are "only ever getting easier with
LLM-based coding agents".

---

## What you get without changing a line

- <em>Compact object headers</em>: smaller heaps, one flag (JEP 519, Java 25)
- <em>Virtual threads</em> no longer pin on `synchronized` (JEP 491, Java 24)
- <em>JFR</em>: CPU-time profiling, method tracing (JEPs 509, 520, Java 25)
- <em>AOT cache</em>: faster startup and warm-up (JEPs 483, 515, Java 24–25)

<span class="aside">…and then records, pattern matching, sealed types, text blocks.</span>

Note:
Hardwood leans on virtual threads, the Vector API, FFM and JFR (see the
"Modern Java FTW" slide in the Hardwood talk).

Check the JEP list against the current release before the talk.

## First, understand what's there

<img class="post post-tall" src="_inputs/images/x-2026-01-23-flink-pipeline-diagram.png" alt="Jan 23: Claude Code draws a Flink pipeline as an ASCII diagram from its source code">

Note:
Before you can pin down behaviour, you have to know what the system does. A
Flink pipeline, drawn straight from its source.

For a client's twelve-year-old system, this is where the agent earns its keep
first: reading, not writing.

## Three turns

| | Magic | Midnight | What stayed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Jan–Feb | The reader parses the taxi data within days | if/else sprawl; the edited test | Conformance and parity tests |
| Mar–Jun | Beta, S3, predicate push-down | Three days on one redesign; waiting on the agent | Thrift fields checked against the spec; differential oracles |
| Jul–Sep | The writer, the Z300, performance work | Five wrong causes; parallel sessions; the Sep 11 post | Rules, skills, the predicate audit, a faster build |

Note:
The evidence that the spiral isn't a figure of speech. Don't read the table;
point at the last column.

Reconstructed from posts, commits and session transcripts. Check each row
against your memory before the talk.

## The agent runs in a container

<img class="post" src="_inputs/images/x-2026-02-01-sandboxing.png" alt="Feb 1: running Claude Code exclusively in a container with just a single mounted directory, out of an abundance of caution">

Note:
The lead-in for "So I can walk away", if that slide wants the evidence in front
of the YAML. Out at the moment because the YAML carries it alone, and two slides
is a lot for scene-setting.

The post is from Feb 1: "out of an abundance of caution". The caution turned out
to be what lets the agent run long without me watching it.

## When prose fails, I sketch the code

<span class="aside">Not to ship it. To say what I mean.</span>

Note:
Twenty seconds, and people will remember it.

Sometimes the fastest way to explain the shape I want is to write eight lines
of it by hand and hand them over. Code as a communication medium rather than a
deliverable.

<object class="chart" type="image/svg+xml" data="_inputs/images/timeline-full.svg" aria-label="Timeline of selected posts, January to September, column height by likes"></object>

Note:
"The story I told you was tidy. Here's the actual year." The turns overlap:
magic and midnight sit weeks apart all year long.

The whole year in one picture. The frenzy at the start; "software is solved"
doesn't match my observations in August; the mental-load post towering over
everything in September.

And the last one: "AI really lets you build things that you otherwise just
wouldn't." It's still fun.

Data: timeline/posts.tsv (likes on X). Very small counts get a minimum column
height so they stay visible; exact numbers are in the tooltips.

## The <em>what</em> gets more formal

Example tests → differential oracles → property tests → formal specifications

Note:
An outlook, not a prediction. If checking is the bottleneck and the moat is in
executable specifications, the direction is towards specifications a machine
can check. Writing specs and proofs used to be the expensive part; agents make
that cheaper too.

For most of the room, the practical step is the middle: differential and
property-based tests.

## Decisions are not findings

```markdown
- **Q:** Keep the per-class duplication or extract a helper?
  - [ ] **A.** Extract a shared helper
  - [ ] **B.** Keep per-class, document why
  - [ ] **C.** Keep as-is
  - **Rec:** B — the classes are about to diverge
```

Note:
Some review items aren't fixes, they're forks: two defensible options and
somebody has to own the choice. The agent lifts them out, does the analysis,
recommends one, and I tick a box. The file becomes the record of the decision.

For consultants: this is the shape of every decision you take to a client.

## Review, as an artifact

Note:
Findings as checkboxes in a file, in priority order. A second skill walks the
file and ticks them off as they're addressed.

221 of these files.

The comment thread is gone after the merge. The file is still there, and the next
review starts from it.

## "If the author shipped this exact line tomorrow, what specifically breaks?"

This is the most transferable slide in the section. It works for human
reviewers tomorrow, no agent required.

<blockquote class="transcript">
"'all three bugs reproduce before the fix and match both oracles after' — that's not what the table suggests for 1142?"

Note:
Reviewing the claim, in practice. The agent's summary said one thing, and the
table directly above it said another. The diff was fine. The claim wasn't.

Say it first as the claim everyone makes. Click: no *mandatory* dependencies.
Compression codecs (snappy, zstd, lz4, brotli) are optional, and you add only

## "Can we stop any probing or guessing, this drives me crazy."

<span class="aside">Me, to Claude</span>

Note:
Lead-in, from a writer regression in August: four confident theories, each with
arithmetic behind it, three refuted by the measurements. "The benchmark says I
was wrong again — it got worse." What found it: a measurement (`-prof gc`).

Let it land. Everyone in the room who has used an agent has wanted to type this.

Don't soften it. This is what midnight sounds like.

<!-- .slide: class="hero" -->

## What raises the floor is what outlasts the turn.

<span class="aside">Checks. Skills. Rules in the build. Not the instructions I gave in the moment.</span>

Note:
The five wrong causes became written rules. The co-author rule moved from
prose into the settings file. The rebase trouble became a skill. The edited
test became "changes to the oracle get read line by line".

This is "prose rots, checks don't" again, now as the reason the trend goes up.

<div class="term">

<div class="term-body">
<p class="term-user">&gt; can we take a step back. you said you copied the workspace, and it was fast for that copy. how can that be.</p>
<div class="fragment">
<p>Straight answer: <strong>because the copy wasn't the same tree.</strong> My <code>tar</code> had <code>--exclude=./.claude --exclude=./_tmp --exclude=./.docker-venv</code>. I excluded precisely the directories that turned out to be the cause […]</p>
<p>So my "250× — the filesystem is the entire variable" claim was an artefact of my own <code>tar</code> flags. […] <mark>Bad instrument, confidently wrong conclusion</mark>, and it sent us down the filesystem path for several rounds.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

Note:
Hunting the licence check, the agent had built a clean experiment: copy the
workspace to a fast filesystem, run the check there, compare. Fast. Its
conclusion, with a number: "250×, the filesystem is the entire variable." We
spent several rounds on filesystems.

I didn't read any code for this. I asked how the fast copy could be fast.

Click: its answer. The copy had left out exactly the directories that were the
cause, because an earlier probe (counting the wrong callback) said they were
never walked. A confident conclusion from a broken instrument. One question about
the claim undid it.

Exact wording from the session transcript (05ac5299, Sep 7, 18:46 UTC), with
cuts marked. The session was compacted later, so this is rendered, not a
screenshot.
