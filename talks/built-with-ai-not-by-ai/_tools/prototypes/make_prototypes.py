</div>

Note:
Prototype, replaces the transcript slide in the review chapter. Three clicks.

Setup: a DECIMAL column stores numbers as bytes, and you could search it with
a byte value. Hardwood compared the bytes as plain byte strings. The bytes of
-2.56 start with FF, which sorts above 7F, the bytes of 1.27. So "amount greater
than 1.27" returned -2.56.

On arrival: Claude's summary of the before/after run against parquet-java and
DuckDB, and the row for that bug. Before the fix: -2.56, the bug reproduces.
That half of the claim holds.

Click 1: the other half doesn't. The fix doesn't compare correctly, it refuses.
Hardwood throws, while both oracles answer. "Matches both oracles" reported a
design decision as parity.

Click 2: my question. I didn't read the code for this. I read the sentence
against the table.

Click 3: why refuse? The PR said: 1.27 can be stored as 7F or padded as 00 7F,
so a byte-by-byte search with 7F could miss a padded value. Claude wrote a test
file storing 1.27 as 00 7F and searched it with 7F. parquet-java finds 1.27 in
it, because it compares these bytes as numbers. The reason, repeated in the
issue, the PR, the release note and the docs, was false. The claim wasn't just
sloppy wording: it hid the one decision in the PR that was wrong. I reworked
the PR, and it now matches both oracles.

The diff was fine. The claim wasn't.

Click 1: it's wrong for Hardwood. The reader runs two virtual threads per
column and decodes pages concurrently inside a row group. Row-group size doesn't
bound its parallelism at all. I flagged it, and it was corrected the next day
(2c71576d).

Click 2: nothing else could have caught it. Tests don't read docs. The docs build

Prototype. Measured: every API response in the session transcripts since Aug 10
(when the kept transcripts start), priced at list prices: Opus 5 at $5/$25 per
million tokens, cache writes 1.25x (5 min) or 2x (1 h), cache reads 0.1x.
${measured:,.0f} for Hardwood work, talk sessions excluded. Most of it is cache
reads: long contexts re-sent every turn.

Extrapolated: before Aug 10, each week's lines added on main (data files, reviews
and the talk excluded) times the measured cost per line added,
${per_line:.3f}. That assumes spring cost per line was like August's; the models
and the way of working were different, so treat the hatched part as an order of
magnitude.

Say it as "on the order of ${cum[-1] / 1000:.0f}k at API list prices". It isn't what I
paid: a subscription costs a fraction. And it's only the sessions in this
container.

Note:
Prototype C for slide 44, with the box's photo in the middle node: the chapter's
loop, made physical. The agent pushes the branch, the box measures, the numbers
come back, and it goes again, unattended.

Spoken: why a separate box (macOS blocks dtrace, no clean way to pin a core, the
laptop runs everything else), why this one (eight cores of one kind), the
downsides (one memory channel, no AVX-512), and that I read the conclusions and
the numbers under them. "The number decides what worked" comes one slide later,
so the caveat doesn't need to be on this slide.

Note:
Prototype, replaces slide 28. {first} to {last}; the 2.7 minutes is the median gap.
Every tick is a prompt I typed to an agent on Sep 9, the busiest day in the
transcripts (Jul 8 to Sep 16; times in Europe/Berlin). Tool approvals don't
count, so the real number of decisions is higher. Click: the same ticks, one row
per session, in the order they started. Every jump between rows is a context
switch.

Click: zoom into 17:50 to 18:35, the 45 minutes with the most switches. The line
follows me from prompt to prompt.
